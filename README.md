 Our project was to create a website as seen below and use grid to for the layout.
 
 We were allowed to use different images with the profile images and a few titles.
 I created the similiar page as seen below.

Each image above shows a different hover state that was created for the project.
Also we had to create media queries to make our site work on other screen sizes.

I collapsed the side menu navigation and created another as the website becomes smaller.
